Note,As this point is in NSW the advice provided on losses and pre-burst on the <a href="./nsw_specific">NSW Specific Tab of the ARR Data Hub</a> is to be considered.  In NSW losses are derived considering a hierarchy of approaches depending on the available loss information.  Probability neutral burst initial loss values for NSW are to be used in place of the standard initial loss and pre-burst as per the losses hierarchy.
